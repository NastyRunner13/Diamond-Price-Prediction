## Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using a regression algorithm to predict diamond prices based on the given features.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Prediction
Users can input new diamond features to get predictions on the diamond price using the trained model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting diamond prices based on various characteristics. It serves as a foundation for further improvements and fine-tuning of the predictive model.
